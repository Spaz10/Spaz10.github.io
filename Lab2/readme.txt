    ** Describes how to use your program

        You can run this program similarly as last time. Make sure all four files are in the same folder.
        Open stevengwLab2.html in a  web browser.

        Once open you may click on diferent buttons to select diferent parts of the robot
            Whole
            Arms
            Single Arm
            Arm piece

        Once a part is selected you may translate, rotate, or scale the part with the folowing controls

        Translate:
        f - forward
        b - backward
        l - left
        r - right

        Rotate:
        Click and drag within the canvas using your mouse

        Scale:
        s - make the part smaller
        (shift) S - make the part larger

        There are also buttons to change background color, and redraw the canvas to original

     ** States which bonus tasks you attempted

        I attempted first to add interesting color to the circles.
        I found it dififcult to see the rotation in the circle for the robot's head, 
        so I attempted to create diferent patterns in order to see rotation more easily.
        Using modulo I was able to create a striped look.
        Using division I was able to create a half and half look.

        I also attempted to make the backgoun square near the bottom rotate, but
        I was unable to get it to work. I could not figure out how to constantly 
        update the matrix with rotation over time.


        Also, I understand that the rotation is not flat, rather it is 2d.
        I understand why it does that, but every time I tried to fix it, I was left withi
        nothing drawing to the screen. I chose to keep the 3D depth rotation as a stylistic choice.

        
     ** Lists which browser/OS you developed your code on (just in case)
        
        I used firefox and Windows 7 and Windows 10 to develop my code
